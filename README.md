# TodoMVC (REACT)

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

## Demo

- [Live Demo](https://asaloff.github.io/test-react-todomvc/)


## Implementation

The following NPM packages were used:

- Redux (global state store)
- uuid (unique ids for todo items)
- form-serialize (extract new todo item text)
- reactstrap (react component library that uses bootstrap)

Used Bootstrap 4 grid for layout.

Since there is no backend, data is not persisted when the page reloads.
